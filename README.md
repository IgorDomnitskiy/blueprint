## Shopping mall blueprint visualization

My Python project creates a dashboard-like visualization of data linked to a blueprint of a shopping mall. 

You load an image of the mall plan, convert it to grayscale, find its contours, and plot them. You then read store data from an Excel file and merge it with the contours data. Using the matplotlib library, you plot colored patches on each contour with store names and some other data displayed when hovering over the patches. You also include a slider widget that allows users to filter the stores based on their turnover. 

Overall, this project offers a simple and effective way to visualize data on a mall plan.
